Schedule WooCommerce discounts that run themselves. BOGO, tiered pricing, flash sales - campaigns activate automatically.

== Description ==

**Stop manually updating sale prices. Schedule it once, let it run forever.**

You've been there: It's 11:58 PM on Black Friday eve. You're clicking through hundreds of products, setting sale prices one by one. Tomorrow morning, you'll do it all again to remove them. There has to be a better way.

**There is.**

Smart Cycle Discounts turns WooCommerce discount management from a recurring headache into a one-time setup. Create a campaign, set your schedule, walk away. Your discounts activate at midnight, deactivate when the sale ends, and you never touch a single product page.

= The 5-Step Campaign Wizard =

No documentation needed. No settings buried in submenus. Just answer five questions:

1. **What's it called?** Name your campaign and set its priority
2. **Which products?** All of them, specific ones, or let us pick randomly
3. **What discount?** Percentage off, fixed amount, or advanced types (Pro)
4. **When does it run?** Set exact start/end dates with timezone support
5. **Ready to launch?** Review everything and go live

Your first campaign takes under 2 minutes. Your hundredth takes the same.

= What You Can Do (Free) =

**Run unlimited campaigns** - No artificial limits. Create 5 campaigns or 500.

**Three ways to select products:**
- **All Products** - Store-wide sale in one click
- **Specific Products** - Hand-pick items by name, SKU, or ID
- **Random Products** - Auto-rotate which products go on sale

**Two discount types:**
- **Percentage Off** - "25% off everything"
- **Fixed Amount** - "$10 off every item"

**Set it and forget it scheduling:**
- Precise date/time control down to the minute
- Automatic activation and deactivation
- Draft mode to prepare campaigns in advance

**Campaign health monitoring:**
- Real-time validation catches mistakes before they go live
- Priority system (1-5) prevents conflicts when campaigns overlap
- Bulk actions to manage multiple campaigns at once

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Smart Cycle Discounts compatible with my theme? =

Yes. Smart Cycle Discounts is a backend plugin that works with any properly coded WordPress theme. It integrates with WooCommerce's native sale price system, so your theme's existing sale price styling applies automatically.

= Can I schedule campaigns in advance? =

Yes. Use the Schedule step in the wizard to set specific start and end dates/times. Campaigns activate and deactivate automatically based on your schedule. You can create campaigns weeks or months in advance.

= How many campaigns can I create? =

There are no campaign limits - you can create and run **unlimited campaigns** in both the free and Pro versions.

= What's the difference between the discount types? =

**Free Version:**
- **Percentage**: Reduce price by a percentage (e.g., 25% off = $100 product becomes $75)
- **Fixed Amount**: Reduce price by fixed amount (e.g., $10 off = $100 product becomes $90)

**Pro Version:**
- **Tiered**: Quantity-based discounts (e.g., Buy 5 get 10% off, Buy 10 get 20% off)
- **BOGO**: Buy One Get One offers with flexible configurations
- **Spend Threshold**: Discount based on cart total (e.g., Spend $100 get 15% off)

= Will this slow down my site? =

No. Smart Cycle Discounts uses optimized database queries, efficient caching, and loads assets only on admin pages where needed. Frontend performance is not impacted. The plugin is designed to handle thousands of products efficiently.

= Can I run multiple campaigns at the same time? =

Yes. You can run unlimited campaigns simultaneously. Use the Priority field (1-5, where 5 is highest priority) to control which campaign takes precedence when multiple campaigns affect the same product.

= What's the difference between "All Products", "Specific Products", and "Random Products"? =

* **All Products** - Applies discount to your entire product catalog
* **Specific Products** - You manually select which products to discount using the AJAX-powered product search
* **Random Products** - Plugin automatically selects X random products from your catalog when the campaign runs

= Does it work with WooCommerce HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage)? =

Yes. Smart Cycle Discounts is fully compatible with WooCommerce HPOS and has been tested with custom order tables.

= Can I duplicate an existing campaign? =

Yes. On the Campaigns list page, hover over any campaign and click the "Duplicate" action. This creates a copy of the campaign with all settings intact, which you can then modify as needed.

= How does the priority system work? =

When multiple campaigns affect the same product, the campaign with the highest priority (5 = highest, 1 = lowest) takes precedence. This lets you run multiple campaigns without conflicts - for example, a high-priority flash sale can override a lower-priority seasonal sale.

= Can I export campaign data? =

Campaign analytics and export features are available in the **Pro version**. Pro users can export campaign performance data in CSV or JSON format, and schedule automated reports.

= What happens when a campaign ends? =

When a campaign reaches its end date/time, it automatically deactivates and removes the sale prices from affected products. The campaign remains in your list as "Ended" and can be duplicated or reactivated with new dates.

= Is there a way to test campaigns before activating them? =

Yes. Use the **Draft** status to create and configure campaigns without activating them. You can review the campaign settings, check the health score, and preview which products will be affected. When ready, change the status to Active or Scheduled.

= Does it work with variable products? =

Yes. Smart Cycle Discounts fully supports WooCommerce variable products. When you apply a discount to a variable product, all variations receive the discount automatically. The sale price displays correctly on both the main product page and individual variation selections.

= Can I exclude products that are already on sale? =

Yes. The plugin respects existing sale prices. If a product already has a manual sale price set in WooCommerce, you can configure your campaign to skip those products or override them based on your preference.

= Does it work alongside WooCommerce coupons? =

Yes. Campaign discounts and WooCommerce coupons work independently. Campaign discounts apply to product prices (shown as sale prices), while coupons apply at checkout. Customers can use both together unless you configure specific restrictions.

= What happens if two campaigns affect the same product? =

The campaign with the higher priority wins. Each campaign has a priority setting from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). When multiple active campaigns include the same product, only the highest-priority discount applies. This prevents discount stacking and gives you full control over which promotions take precedence.
